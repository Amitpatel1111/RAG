# Weaviate RAG Lab

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the fundamentals of the **Weaviate API** for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## 📌 Overview

The notebook provides a hands-on introduction to using Weaviate as a vector database. It covers the essential workflow required to store, index, and retrieve data efficiently for semantic applications.

## 🚀 Key Topics

* Setting up the Weaviate client (embedded mode)
* Creating and configuring collections
* Adding data objects
* Performing queries with:

  * Filters
  * Semantic search
  * BM25 search
  * Hybrid search
  * Reranking

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to build a foundational understanding of how vector databases power modern AI retrieval systems and prepare for implementing production-ready RAG pipelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Weaviate
* Vector Embeddings
